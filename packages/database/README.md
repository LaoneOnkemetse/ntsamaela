## üìù Notes

- All timestamps use UTC
- Soft deletes are not implemented (use status fields instead)
- Foreign key constraints use CASCADE for most relations
- AdminReview uses RESTRICT to prevent admin deletion
- UUIDs are used for all primary keys (CUID format)

## üîí Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM
