## üîó Database Relationships

### One-to-One Relationships
- User ‚Üî Driver (for driver users)
- User ‚Üî Wallet
- User ‚Üî Verification

### One-to-Many Relationships
- User ‚Üí Package (customer creates packages)
- User ‚Üí AdminReview (admin performs reviews)
- Driver ‚Üí Trip
- Driver ‚Üí Bid
- Driver ‚Üí Transaction
- Package ‚Üí Bid
- Package ‚Üí Transaction
- Trip ‚Üí Bid
- Verification ‚Üí AdminReview

### Foreign Key Constraints
- CASCADE deletion for most relationships
- RESTRICT deletion for AdminReview to prevent admin deletion
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields

  - 8 enums for status and type management
  - Comprehensive indexing strategy
  - Foreign key constraints with appropriate cascade rules

### Seed Data Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/database/seed.ts`
- **Content**: Comprehensive test data for all models
- **Features**:
  - 5 test users (1 admin, 2 customers, 2 drivers)
  - Complete data relationships across all models
  - Realistic test scenarios
  - Pre-hashed passwords for security
