# TEMPORARILY DISABLED - Will be re-enabled when test suites are implemented
# This workflow requires:
# - Complete unit test implementations for all apps
# - Integration tests with database
# - E2E tests with Detox (mobile) and Playwright (web)
# - Security scanning tools (Snyk, Semgrep, OWASP ZAP)
# - Performance testing infrastructure
#
# To re-enable: rename this file back to .yml extension
